Each medicine has a code which follows a pattern too complex for bootleg companies to understand: <r>the letters in the code must be in alphabetical order.<k>  Of course, bootleg companies aren't completely incompetent: they have used neural networks to analyze the pattern of these letters. So, they can produce codes that are almost correct, but never exactly correct. <br> <br> Example valid code: aabcf <br> Example invalid code: aa<r>cb<k>f",

Thankfully, scientists have invented a beneficial virus that lets you eat things that are typically inedible, as long as you eat something edible afterwards.  Unthankfully, unforseen complications have made it so that the reverse is also true: after everything edible, you must eat something inedible!  You have to alternate between eating something deadly and something not deadly.",
